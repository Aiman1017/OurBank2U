User Story: OurBank2U Web App --> 
As a user i would like to see the calculations via a loan calculator before actually applying for the loan.  
Once i am comfortable with the calculations which are based on my inputs, i would want to be able to proceed to apply for the loan by clicking on a proceed button.
I would like a simple interface to repay the loan, including all the neccessary loan details. The loan payment web app is a representation of this need.

Note: The currency list soap api does not work on github pages due to Github's HTTPS protocol. To remedy this, kindly extract the files and run them on your localhost.
